# Maze Solving AI Agent  
**Description**  
This project features an AI agent that learns to navigate through a maze using the Q-learning algorithm. Represented by a triangle, the agent explores the maze to find a path from a start point (S) to a goal point (G).  

**Technologies Used**  
Python  
NumPy  
Matplotlib  

**Setup and Installation**  
Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:  
Python (3.x recommended)  
NumPy  
Matplotlib  
You can install the required packages using pip:  
`pip install numpy matplotlib`  

**Running the Project**  
To run the project, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command in the terminal:  
`python game.py`  
This will start the maze simulation and display the AI agent's progress in real-time.  

**Project Structure**  
game.py: The main script that initializes and runs the maze simulation.  
qagent.py: Contains the implementation of the Q-learning agent.  
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
